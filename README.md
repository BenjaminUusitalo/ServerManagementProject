# ServerManagementProject

Mini Project for Tero Karvinen's Server Management ICT4TN022-3014 - 2021 course

In this project I will attempt to make a salt state, which I can use to install, run and manage some useful everyday programs. 

With this, if I ever install a new machine for which I want these programs up and running, this state will do so with essentially a single command.
